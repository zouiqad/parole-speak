# parole-speak
ParoleSpeak is a web application developed using React and AWS, specifically designed to transform text into French vocals using Amazon Polly. This project was undertaken to deepen my understanding and proficiency in AWS services, offering users a seamless text-to-speech experience with a focus on French language output.
